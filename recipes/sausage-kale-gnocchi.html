        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Plate up this delicious one-pot of sausage, kale and gnocchi in just 20 minutes, with just five minutes prep. Midweek suppers never got so easy â€“ or tasty!</p>
        
        <p>I used to make this all the time at Alexandra using real sausages, but you can easily switch the Richmond Veggie sausages to make it veggie.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>6 pork sausages</li>
                <li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
                <li>1 tsp fennel seeds (optional)</li>
                <li>500g fresh gnocchi</li>
                <li>500ml chicken stock (fresh if you can get it)</li>
                <li>100g chopped kale</li>
                <li>40g parmesan, finely grated</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large high-sided frying pan over a medium heat.</li>
                <li>Squeeze the sausages straight from their skins into the pan, then use the back of a wooden spoon to break the meat up.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle in the chilli flakes and fennel seeds, if using, then fry until the sausage meat is crisp around the edges.</li> 
                <li>Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon.</li>
                <li>Tip the gnocchi into the pan, fry for a minute or so, then pour in the chicken stock.</li>
                <li>Once bubbling, cover the pan with a lid and cook for 3 mins, then stir in the kale.</li>
                <li>Cook for 2 mins more or until the gnocchi is tender and the kale has wilted.</li>
                <li>Stir in the parmesan, then season with black pepper and scatter the crisp sausage meat over the top.</li>
            </ol>
